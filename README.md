# PulsedLightSignatures
***NOTE:*** *Rather than wait until this was completely polished to publish, we've decided to just release as a work in progress. Keep checking back for updates!*

This is a concept proposal for acquiring, analyzing and identifying the "signatures" (or unique data set) produced objects intersecting one or multiple range-finder beams.  While this proposal is focused primarily on elucidating the validity of "signatures" as a method of object identification we will use a few sample application scenarios in our discussion:
- Doorway
	- Gait detection
	- Tying information to a database of other attributes (id info)
- Optical Fence
	- Single-Beam
	- Multi-Beam
		- Single-sided
		- Double-sided
- Area Scanner
	- Single-Beam Static
	- Multi-Beam Static
	- Single Beam rotation
		- what scannable is building
	- Multi-Beam rotation
		- 9 sensor thing

Currently we have no specific algorithms or solutions for determining the identity of specific objects, rather this proposal and accompanying research (like our [3d Scanner Project](https://github.com/PulsedLight3D/PulsedLight3dScanner) ) serve as the basis for research into this area.

***NOTE:*** *Where specific range-finding technology is referenced, we use the LIDAR-Lite v2 module by PulsedLight but is applicable to other rangefinding devices.Â *
